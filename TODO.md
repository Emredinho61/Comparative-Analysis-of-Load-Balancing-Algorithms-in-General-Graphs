# TODOs for the Project

## Implementation
- [] comment code

## Organisational:
- [] Register project via mail - Frau moses

## Discussion:
- networksizes with 2 to the power of sth for Torus, other networksizes with 10 to power of...
- squares and special rectangles for torus - and also rather symmetrical approaches
- plot some Graphs into one plot such that we can see how different networksizes impact the Graphs
- plot with different scales for the MSE axis maybe to see how this behaves in the ranges of 10โด and 10ยน and so on
